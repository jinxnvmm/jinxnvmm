Hi fellow programmer, if you're here that because you found my work fine and interesting. I'm a little programmer from somewhere who codes sometimes (broke commit streak because of fortnite sadly) to make useless and sometimes interesting stuff. feel free to check my projects and if you want to contact me, you can do it at my discord: **@aveliades** (im not always active here)

*And yea i'm so lazy to make a custom colorful and shiny Github profile and btw i hate them they're so...shiny for me.*
